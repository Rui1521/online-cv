    title: BIOGRAPHY
    summary: |
      I am an AI Research Scientist at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/). Before that, I was fortunate to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), under the guidance of [Prof. Tess Smidt](https://blondegeek.github.io/). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/).

      My research spans AI for healthcare, AI for science, geometric deep learning, and spatiotemporal modeling, with a focus on integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning models to enhance their accuracy, interpretability, and generalization for large-scale complex tasks.
