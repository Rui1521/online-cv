    title: BIOGRAPHY
    summary: |
      I am a PhD Candidate at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/).
      I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics from 
      [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) and Master degree in Data Science from [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu).
      
      My research primarily lies in deep learning, especially for spatiotemporal data. In particular, I'm interested into building accurate, interpretable and generalizable deep forecasting models for large-scale real-world data. My works have been applied to forecasting spatiotemporal systems in finance, epidemiology, healthcare, traffic and physical sciences. For more details, see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6CrR0Ae-wF0GktRuU12ScOq8FipAKsw/view?usp=sharing) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lEmjtfIAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).
   
      I will join [Prof. Tess Smidt's group](https://blondegeek.github.io/) as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT in August.
