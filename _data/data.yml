    title: BIOGRAPHY
    summary: |
      I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science from [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), 
      advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/). I received my Bachelor degree of Science in Applied Mathematics from 
      [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
      My research interests include spatiotemporal learning and 
      the physics-informed deep learning. Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JXG5QZwAAAAJ&hl=en).
