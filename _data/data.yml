    title: BIOGRAPHY
    summary: |
      I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science from [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), 
      advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/). I received my Bachelor degree of Science in Applied Mathematics from 
      [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
      My research interests include [spatiotemporal learning](https://stl.khoury.northeastern.edu/) and 
      the interplay between deep learning and partial differential equations.
